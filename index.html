          <p>
            Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and
            auto geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment. It’s also
            an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone,
            from Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads – no matter their
            driving skill or mechanical knowledge. It’s an occasionally goofy
            but always earnest Valentine to Mexico’s world-famous culture, and a
            romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect
            vacation vistas. It’s a long haul, MMO-inspired racer that’s
            exploding with more races, activities, and event types than can
            comfortably fit on some parts of the map – and yet it still always
            feels relaxed rather than daunting. It never locks you into
            something you don’t want to do and steadily rewards you for however
            you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent,
            and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things.
            Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak
            of its craft and the best open-world racing game I’ve ever played.

          <p>
            It is no exaggeration to say that Elden Ring is FromSoftware’s
            largest and most ambitious game yet, and that ambition has more than
            paid off. Even after 87 hours of blood, sweat, and tears that
            included some of the most challenging fights I’ve ever fought, and
            innumerable surprises, there are still bosses that I left on the
            table, secrets that I’ve yet to uncover, sidequests that I missed
            out on, tons of weapons, spells, and skills that I’ve never used.
            And this is all on top of PVP and cooperative play that I’ve barely
            been able to scratch the surface of. Throughout it all, while the
            fundamentals of combat haven’t changed much from what we’ve seen
            before, the enormous variety of viciously designed enemies and the
            brutal but surmountable bosses have brought its battles to a new
            level. Even with all the threads I didn’t manage to tug on my first
            playthrough (of what I’m sure will be several), what I was treated
            to can easily be held amongst the best open-world games I’ve ever
            played. Like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild before it,
            Elden Ring is one that we’ll be looking back on as a game that moved
            a genre forward.

          <p>
            Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon Zero Dawn juggles
            many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity -
            combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and
            behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which
            needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side
            questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are
            compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep
            rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion.
